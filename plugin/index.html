            <p>It is my pleasure to bring greetings on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Jamaica Library Service, I must
                share with you a quote from the Minister of Education in 1946 during the debate in the House of Representatives
                over the proposal to establish the JLS. </p>
            <p>This is what he said:“….It must be remembered that the expansion of a Library service is most favourably related
                with the growth of democratic ideas. What in the past was for the few, is now for the many to enjoy such
                access.”</p>
            <p>Seventy (70) years later there is hardly a Jamaican community without access to library services served through
                either a parish, branch, mobile library or a school library. The Jamaica Library Service has made it to this
                platinum year largely because of the foundation built by the legendary pioneers the dedicated and creative
                employees; the leadership of the Jamaica Library Board and the Parish Library Committees; the principals
                and teachers, who partner with us in delivering library services to government school libraries.</p>
            <p>We acknowledge the dedication of an islandwide cadre of staff who work tirelessly to keep the doors of the peoples
                university open, thereby providing access to knowledge in various formats; whether largely by books, as back
                in 1948, or the combination of books and bytes today as well as and an extensive range of cultural and educational
                programmes. Without any doubt or fear of contradiction, Jamaica is the better for having had the Jamaica
                Library Service.
            </p>
            <p>As a Director of the Board of Management it would be remiss of me not to admit that the JLS faces many challenges
                today, as do many libraries worldwide. One challenge is correcting the myth that libraries are no longer
                needed in the Google-age. If that were true, why would there have been over 2 million visits to the 118 Branch
                and Parish Libraries across Jamaica, or why would the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2014 grant the
                JLS over US$2 million to beef up its ICT capacities?</p>
            <p>The medium is changing but not the message—libraries are the right hand of civilized and prosperous societies
                and the JLS in this its 70th year is only more determined to live up to the expectations of the members of
                the 1946 House of Representatives and to deliver on our promise as stated in our Mission Statement, which
                is,
                <i>“to enable national development through the creation and support of a knowledge-based society of culturally
                    aware lifelong learners by providing universal access to information…”</i>
            </p>
            <p>As we celebrate the 70th anniversary with a yearlong programme of activities in our libraries islandwide under
                the theme “celebrating the journey, shaping the future” ….. we will continue to inform citizens and remind
                stakeholders that libraries are far from obsolete and will indeed shape the future as essential service providers
                in an information obsessed future. There is much to celebrate and we invite you and all Jamaicans to join
                with us. We look forward to serving you.</p>
